                <p>I'm currently part of BEES, the technology division of the largest brewery in the world, Ambev. In our team, we use technologies like Typescript, React, Effector, Context, Git, Azure, and implement unit testing using React Testing Library and Jest, as well as component testing with Cypress, following SCRUM for agile development. Our current project is a marketplace for products for bars and beer-related establishments. We are responsible for developing the inventory, orders, dashboard, reports, insights, and engagement micro-frontends. We practice pair programming and code review, and adhere to clean code and refactoring principles.
                
                I recently gave a talk at Bees Talks about "What it's like to be a Frontend Dev?", discussing the technologies and methodologies we use in our team. I also created a study plan for beginners in my team, as I'm passionate about education and knowledge sharing, and believe it's a great way to learn.
